    <h2>Hot Toys</h2>

    <p>A hobby of mine is collecting high-end 1/6 scale figures. More specifically, figures from the Star Wars
      franchise.
      These figures are made by Hot Toys.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Toys">
      <p>"Hot Toys is a Hong Kong-based production house for designing, developing, and manufacturing highly detailed
        collectible merchandise to worldwide markets. Established in 2000, the company initially focused on
        producing 1:6 scale U.S. military special forces action figures before transitioning to production of high-end
        figures based
        on media properties, primarily under their Movie Masterpiece Series brand."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I purchase these figures online from <a href="https://www.sideshow.com/">Sideshow Collectibles</a>, the exclusive
      distributor of Hot Toys collectible
      figures in the United States.</p>

    <p>I first started collecting these figures about a year and a half ago. They are priced fairly high, but the
      quality
      of the figure is more than worth the price point. Plus each and every figure you buy will almost always be worth
      more on the secondary market once the figure sells out. And the figure will ALWAYS sell out because only a limited
      amount of each figure, or each version of said figure, are made. Once they sell out, they will never be re-stocked
      which results in the figures selling on eBay for double, if not triple the price you originally paid. So the
      figures
      are very high value as well. </p>
