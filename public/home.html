      <p class="first-letter">
        A hobby of mine is collecting high-end 1/6 scale figures. More
        specifically, figures from the Star Wars franchise. These figures are
        made by Hot Toys.
      </p>

      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Toys">
        <p>
          "Hot Toys is a Hong Kong-based production house for designing,
          developing, and manufacturing highly detailed collectible merchandise
          to worldwide markets. Established in 2000, the company initially
          focused on producing 1:6 scale U.S. military special forces action
          figures before transitioning to production of high-end figures based
          on media properties, primarily under their Movie Masterpiece
          Series brand."
        </p>

      <p>
        I purchase these figures online from
        <a href="https://www.sideshow.com/">Sideshow Collectibles</a>, the
        exclusive distributor of Hot Toys collectible figures in the United
        States.
      </p>

      <p>
        I first started collecting these figures about a year and a half ago.
        They are priced fairly high, but the quality of the figure is more than
        worth the price point. Plus each and every figure you buy will almost
        always be worth more on the secondary market once the figure sells out.
        And the figure will ALWAYS sell out because only a limited amount of
        each figure, or each version of said figure, are made. Once they sell
        out, they will never be re-stocked which results in the figures selling
        on eBay for double, if not triple the price you originally paid. So the
        figures are very high value as well.
